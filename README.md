This program solves square equation.

User can choose the operating mode of the program or close it.

Operating modes of the program:
  1. "t" - test mode (the program receives coefficients from file and compares the roots it has received and their number with the answers from the file)
  2. "m" - manual mode (the user enters the coefficients and the program counts the roots for this case)
  
If the user enters "c" the program will stop.
